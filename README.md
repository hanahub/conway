Conway's Game of Life in JavaScript using Test Driven Development.


### Installation

```
npm install
```

### Start Dev Server

```
npm run dev
```

### Build Prod Version

npm run build
```

### Test:


As a test runner, I used karma(http://karma-runner.github.io/).

First you need to install karma-cli.
$ npm install -g karma-cli

And then you can start karma using “karma start” and run tests using the “karma run” command.
